# Heart Disease Prediction Using Explainable Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the source code for my MSc dissertation project.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to predict the presence of heart disease using structured clinical data and explainable machine learning models. The project compares the performance and interpretability of two machine learning approaches:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

In addition to predictive accuracy, the project focuses on understanding how clinical features contribute to model predictions.

## Repository Contents
- `Harshitha code.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model training and hyperparameter tuning
  - Model evaluation
  - Explainability analysis
- `requirements.txt` – List of required Python libraries
- `README.md` – Project description and usage instructions

## Requirements
This project uses Python and the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required libraries using:
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available heart disease dataset containing clinical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and heart disease diagnosis.

## Notes
This repository is submitted as part of a MSc dissertation. The code is provided for academic and reproducibility purposes.
